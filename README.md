# Automatic_Attendence_Management_System
The goal of the project is to automate the manual process of taking the attendance in the institution's classroom.

First we have trained the machine learning model to detecting and identifying the faces of the candidates. 
We have used the webcam to see the faces of the candidates in real time. After detecting and identifying the candidates, 
we have used mongo-db as a persistent storage to store their attendance.
